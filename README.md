## What is this?

`brokefetch` is the only system info tool that doesn't pretend your life is okay.

Inspired by `neofetch`, but with:
- Sadness
- Regret
- A CRT monitor

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/brokefetch
cd brokefetch
chmod +x brokefetch.sh
./brokefetch.sh
